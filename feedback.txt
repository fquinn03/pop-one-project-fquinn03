At the end invoking play_or_load() will break tests for this module as it will require input from the user. You should wrap calls like this in something like
If __name__ == “__main__”:
    play_or_load()

This makes sure that play_or_load() is called only if this module is being executed on the main thread. It is not executed if the file is being imported as a module.
